1998 - 2016,Roots,"I was born and grew up in Tirana, Albania. I went to a Turkish middle school, and a French High School. My high school was very focused on the social sciences so I also gained a background in Psychology and Critical Thinking in addition to my normal course load. I always had an interest in Math and Computer Science although I wasn't able to practice the latter at school. During this time I also played basketball semi-professionally.",images/tirana.jpg,left,--blue,
2014 - 2017,Volunteering,"I joined the European Youth Parliament (EYP), an NGO that brings together young Europeans to debate current issues facing the union. Similar to Model UN, members of the EYP gather in conferences to discuss and find solutions to these issues. Over the years I attended 9 conferences in 7 EU countries, taking on roles of delegate, journalist, committee chair, and conference organizer. I also served on the board of EYP Albania as a PR chair.",images/eyp.jpg,right,--card-red,
2016 - 2020,Bachelor's,"In 2016 I started my undergraduate studies at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts. I started out as an Electrical and Computer Engineer, then switched to Math and Computer Science. I developed an interest in applied Math principles like numerical and optimization methods. On the CS side, I enjoyed working on web design and data visualization projects.",images/wpi.png,left,--darkcream,
May - Aug 2018,Research,"Received my first research grant through a summer research fund at WPI. I worked with Prof. Vadim Yakovlev on quantifying uniformity of ceramic blocks radiated by millimeter waves. It was my first look into the world of research as well as computational science. I presented this research on multiple conferences and received a prize in one of them!",images/ieee.jpg,right,--blue,
Jan - Mar 2019,Thailand,"Completed a study abroad program in Thailand. In a team of 9 students we researched ways historical site owners can seek financial or legal protection for their properties. The team was made of 5 WPI students and 4 students from Chulalongkorn University.",images/thailand.jpg,left,--card-red,
May - Aug 2019,Internship,"Got my first internship, as a backend software engineer at Dell Technologies. Worked with a team of PowerStore developers to visualize the structure of state machines defined in code. This project helped hundreds of engineers better understand the state machines they were working with and on. I also filed a patent application for a way to optimize the state machines.",images/internship.jpg,right,--darkcream,
2019 - 2020,"Passion, Found!","I took my first web design class and immediately fell in love with it. I worked on five web projects, including a data viz portfolio, a personal travel logger, and an application that incentivises users to exercise through community building and gamification. Later I also took a data visualization class that I also absolutely loved.",images/webware.jpeg,left,--blue,
2019 - 2020,"Capstone","On my last year at WPI I worked on my undergraduate capstone project, on detecting anomalies in brain data generated using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy. I worked with three advisors with three different backgrounds: machine learning, human-computer interaction, and math. It was truly a culmination of all WPI taught me over the years.",images/anomalydetector.jpg,right,--card-red,
Aug 2020 - Present,#delltech,"After graduation I went back to Dell for a full time position as a backend engineer. In my job I don't do just one thing, but pick up any project that needs to be worked on. So far I have created fault injection points, reduced concurrent command limits, and as a hackathon project developed an interactive onboarding course with IntelliJ EduTools.",images/dell2.jpg,left,--darkcream,
