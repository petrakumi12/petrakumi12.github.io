 ,Roots,"I was born and grew up in Tirana, Albania. As a kid I went to a Turkish middle school and a French High School. Coming from a family of photographers, the passion for it was instilled in me since youth. Alongside it I developed an interest in Math and Computer Science, which I practiced at school and in my free time.",images/tirana.jpg,left,--blue,
2014 - Present,Volunteering,"I joined the European Youth Parliament (EYP), an NGO that brings together young Europeans to debate current issues facing the union. Similar to Model UN, members of the EYP gather in conferences to discuss solutions. Over the years I attended 9 conferences in 7 EU countries, taking on various roles:  journalist, committee chair, conference organizer, and Board member for EYP Albania. I try to maintain my relationship with this community by participating in mentoring opportunities",images/eyp.jpg,right,--card-red,

I developed an interest in applied Math principles like numerical and optimization methods. On the CS side, I enjoyed working on full stack and data visualization projects. In my free time I played basketball, was on the leadership board of multiple clubs, and took a job as a web/graphic designer and storyteller at the WPI Global Lab.",images/wpi.png,left,--darkcream,
May - Aug 2018,Research,"My first 'internship' was working on a summer research project at WPI. I worked with Prof. Vadim Yakovlev on quantifying uniformity of ceramic blocks radiated by millimeter waves. I presented this research on multiple conferences, receiving second place for best project in one of them.",images/ieee.jpg,right,--blue,
Jan - Mar 2019,Studies Abroad,"Completed a study abroad program in Thailand. In a team of 9 students we researched ways historical site owners can seek financial or legal protection for their properties. The team was made of 5 WPI students and 4 students from Chulalongkorn University.",images/thailand.jpg,left,--card-red,
May - Aug 2019,Internship,"Got my first internship, as a backend software engineer at Dell Technologies. Worked with a team of PowerStore developers to visualize the structure of state machines defined in code. This project helped hundreds of engineers better understand the state machines they were working with and on. I also filed a patent application for a way to optimize the state machines.",images/internship.jpg,right,--darkcream,
2019 - 2020,"Capstone","On my last year at WPI I worked on my undergraduate capstone project, on detecting anomalies in brain data generated using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy. I worked with three advisors from different backgrounds: machine learning, human-computer interaction, and math. It was truly a culmination of all WPI taught me over the years. This project was awarded the Provost's Award for best project in the Math department, and was featured in the Fall 2020 issue of the WPI Journal.",images/anomalydetector.jpg,right,--card-red,
Aug 2020 - July 2021,#delltech,"After graduation I went back to Dell for a full time position as a backend engineer, working on the PowerStore storage device. I picked up any project that needed to be worked on, trying to learn as much as I could about Storage, our codebase, and enterprise software. Some of my work included developing an interactive onboarding course with IntelliJ EduTools, reducing concurrency overhead, and reducing the allocated java heap by 75%. Above all, I met some of the most amazing and caring people.",images/dell2.jpg,left,--darkcream,
